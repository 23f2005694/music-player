# Auto-generated README (Round 1)

**Project brief:** Create a modern web-based music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should include a play/pause button, next/previous track control, and a progress bar showing playback. Style it with a gradient background, animated buttons, and smooth transitions. Output all necessary files (HTML, CSS, JS) only â€” no explanations or comments.

**Attachments:**
- sample-track.mp3 (audio/mpeg): 9 bytes

**Checks to meet:**
Repo has MIT license
README.md is professional
Music player UI loads and buttons are functional
Audio progress bar updates during playback

## Setup
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. No build steps required.
